SEEM3650 - Introduction to Data and Decision Analytics, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, 2022-2023, Term 2.

In this project, I want to determine if the Air Quality Index can be predicted by weather indicators such as daily temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind speed, and UV index. My motivation is to create a prediction model that Hong Kong citizens can use to get warned about harmful air quality without having to search for specific chemical/environmental data on PM2.5 concentrations, but using more easily-accessible weather information. In the project code, I have implemented and tested the Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression models to predict AQI.

My Project Report describes and demonstrates all results and observations of the project.
